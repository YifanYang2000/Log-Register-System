# Login-Register-System
A preliminary Login/ Registering system, to be implemented in future projects and websites

### Getting started
XAMPP was used in this project. <br />
Once XAMPP and all of its services have started, mount the stack exported data volume<br />
Go into the the newly created network and create a new folder called "login" in the "htdcos" folder<br />
Go on your browser and enter the IP adress and go to PHPadmin<br />
Create a new database called admin. Create a new table "user" with column "Id" (Int, auto increment), "username" (varchar), "email" (varchar) and "password" (varchar).THE TABLE MUST BE CREATED IN THIS ORDER. <br />
Go on your browser and enter the IP adress (given my XAMPP) go to /login/try.php to start experimenting.<br />
The users should appear on the "user" table as new accounts are registered<br />


### Improvements?
For this project, I focused on functionality; the pages are rather bland. Implementing CSS is defintely a futture endeavour <br />
Stay tuned for updates!
